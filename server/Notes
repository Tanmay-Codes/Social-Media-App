//check package.json

1. change the type to module - to use the eslint
2. Add start script to use the nodemon for starting the server.js
3. check if the server.js and the name is the same i.e server in first line of package.json

//add dotenv to server and its config function. now add a file .env with a variable name which is equal to the
connection string of the mongoDB server, with the name and password.

//configure server.js to connect the mongoDB and start the server before making the schema.

## ERRORS and SOLUTION if in the case of creating the user

## Error:

MongoWriteConcernError: No write concern mode named 'majority;' found in replica set configuration

## Solution:

Make sure that in the .env file there is no ";" at the url end as from the following example:

## #Error:

mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.hcyv7.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority;

## #Solved:

mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.hcyv7.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

## In order to connect server to client we are using cors and adding it to the middle ware, we are sending credentials so we also define credentials to true.
