# Social-Media-App
Working on something similar as linked In and facebook and trying to use the MERN stack to successfully deploy the full website with the key features of any social media app

This app consists of work on several technologies:
FrontEnd:
-ReactJS
-ReactHooks
-MUI
-FormiK
-Yup
-Axios

Backend:
-Node
-MongoDB
-Express
-Thunderclient was used to test the backend requests

Currently in the website the primary focus was on working on front end and creating a website layout as fast as possible using MUI library, The website is made fully responsive and the backend is used to 
create the user and login the user to the website for which in the first page the user name with which its login will be shown. Rest most of the data is a dummy data which can be later changed to be as 
a fully functional backend data.
